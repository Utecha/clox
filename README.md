# Lox - C Edition

This is an implementation of the [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) programming language, the bytecode virtual machine version in C.

This is basically a *slightly* modified version of both the original + what I wrote the first time I followed along in this book.

I give kudos for this section of the book in particular because it helped me better understand a lot of things I struggled with in C at the time.
